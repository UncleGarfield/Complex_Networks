# Complex-Networks:-
A large number of real-world systems like Facebook, air-transport, metabolic reactions inside a living cell, and the Internet can be modelled as networks. Also several phenomena like traffic jams, rumour spreading and genetic regulations can be modelled as processes on networks making it an indispensable tool to study ‘complex systems’.
## 1. Introduction to networks. Empirical networks: Technological, Social, Information, Biological.
